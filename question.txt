🔹 1. Security

Pointers allow direct access to memory

This can lead to:

Data corruption

Hacking

Unauthorized access

Java avoids pointers to protect memory

🔹 2. Avoids memory errors

Pointers can cause:

Dangling pointers

Memory leaks

Segmentation faults

Java removes pointers to make programs:

More reliable

Less error-prone

🔹 3. Automatic memory management

Java uses Garbage Collector

Programmer does not free memory manually

No need for pointers like malloc() or free()

🔹 4. Simplicity

Pointers make code complex

Java is designed to be easy for beginners

🔹 5. Java uses references instead
Student s = new Student();


s is a reference, not a pointer

You cannot do pointer arithmetic

Safe and controlled
